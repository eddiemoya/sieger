sieger
======

Bash script that automates multiple siege tests from a JSON config file.

Needs a bunch of cleanup and documentation, and more context as to how to get it running. 

The json file needs to be in a folder in your home directory - or just change the path.
I have a version that lets you pass the file as a parameter, Ill update at a later point.
